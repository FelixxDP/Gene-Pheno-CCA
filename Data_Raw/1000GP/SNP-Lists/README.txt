This folder should only contain SNP lists, in the following format:

1. DESC_ATLAS-XXXX.txt

FORMAT:	rsxxxxx,rsyyyyy,rszzzzz,	etc...

where	DESC	is a brief description of the list	e.g. "topSNPtable"
	XXXX	is the GWAS ATLAS reference number,
		for the study which the SNPs come from	e.g. "3693"

NOTE: 	'top SNP tables' can be downloaded for any GWAS ATLAS dataset 
	(https://atlas.ctglab.nl), but need to be reformatted as shown
