In this folder, you will also need to add the following files (available at https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/resources#1kg_phase3):

1. all_phase3.pgen.vst
2. all_phase3.pvar.vst
3. all_phase3.psam

Decompress 1 & 2 using plink2, to also get:

4. all_phase3.pgen
5. all_phase3.pvar

DO NOT commit any of these file to github, just keep them locally - they are too large for git.
